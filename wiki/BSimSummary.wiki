As well as being a standalone package, BSim is a versatile library of agent based modelling tools. Therefore it is possible to access the code in two slightly different ways, either as a library (`*`.jar file) or by editing the BSim code directly.

Using BSim as a library - Download the BSim.jar file...

Directly editing the BSim code - use SVN (see below). Also add a .jar with the code?

  * BSim as a library
  * The BSim codebase/editing thereof [BSimEclipse (Eclipse and SVN)]
  * Different Branches
  * BSim manual. The BSim manual (link) contains a series of examples of potential uses of BSim. A more in-depth manual describing the features of BSim is currently being written.
