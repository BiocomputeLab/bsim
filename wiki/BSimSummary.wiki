#summary A brief introduction to BSim and its code

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Introduction =

The BSim framework is a cross platform Java based programming API that has been developed from scratch to model the stochastic interactions of bacteria and particles in a fluid based environment. 

It was initially developed as part of the [http://2008.igem.org/Team:BCCS-Bristol Bristol University entry] in the [http://2008.igem.org iGEM 2008] competition in which the team won a bronze medal and overall best model prize. Since then it has also been used by the [http://2009.igem.org/Team:BCCS-Bristol BCCS-Bristol in 2009], where a gold medal was won and overall best model prize retained. iGEM is an international student competition which aims to promote the use of synthetic biology in solving problems in a new way. The BSim system is designed to be highly extendible and available for Windows, Mac OS X and UNIX systems. 

==BSim Package==

So far there are two versions of BSim available for download, from the BCCS-Bristol iGEM projects from 2008 and 2009. We are currently working on updating and expanding the 2009 version to assist in modelling work for our 2010 iGEM entry.

Both the 2008 and 2009 versions of BSim are available to download from the SVN repository, and their final versions are tagged as 1.0 and 2.0 respectively. They are also available as standalone .jar archives, further details of which are provided below.

===BSim 2008 - BSim 1.0===


===BSim 2009 - BSim 2.0===



= Details =

As well as being a standalone package, BSim is a versatile library of agent based modelling tools. Therefore it is possible to access the code in two slightly different ways, either as a library (`*`.jar file) or by editing the BSim code directly.

Using BSim as a library - Download the BSim.jar file...

Directly editing the BSim code - use SVN (see below). Also add a .jar with the code?

  * The BSim codebase/editing thereof [BSimEclipse (Eclipse and SVN)]
  * Different Branches
  * BSim manual. The BSim manual (link) contains a series of examples of potential uses of BSim. A more in-depth manual describing the features of BSim is currently being written.
